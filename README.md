SOIC Breakouts
==============

Breakout boards for SOIC-14 and SOIC-16 that fit in a standard DIP width on a breadboard.
The IC itself sits to the side of the pin headers.

A separate through-hole exists in each board, connected to the ground plane. Solder a
resistor leg or other thin wire from the `GND` hole to top of the header pin that represents
ground for the IC.
